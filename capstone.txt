Idea for capstone project

Idea #1
Rocket hub. This would have multiple apis to space related data and display it on the page.
This would display the position of starlink satilites around the world. 
This would crete a calendar for launch dates.
the theme around each page would be space.

Idea #2
Cat hub for Dallas. Locate stary cat colonies and note the need for resources such as spay/neuter, 
food, and water.
This would utilize APIS for cat location if available. 

Idea #3 
Make a youtube/tiktok. This idea may be too similar to project 4.
